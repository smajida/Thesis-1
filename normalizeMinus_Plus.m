function [X_norm, mu, sigma] = normalizeMinus_Plus(X)
%NORMALIZEMINUS_PLUS Normalizes the features in X 
%   normalizeMinus_Plus(X) returns a normalized version of X where
%   the mean value of each feature is 0 and the standard deviation
%   is 1. This is often a good preprocessing step to do when
%   working with learning algorithms.

%   Discard a features that have only zeros
